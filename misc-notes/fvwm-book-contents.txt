The distribution format is irrespective of whether it's published or not,
and most publishers are keen on electronic formats these days, as well as
paper editions.

Hell, no.  I have no interest in attracting more users; merely documenting
this for those who already know about FVWM.

* Preface...
* Introduction / Explanation as to what window management is (c.f. with
  role within X11, etc.)
* History of FVWM (via comparison with other WMs). 	Explain what FVWM
  is, and why it came about.
* Components of FVWM
 	- Installation (via distributions).
 	- Via vanilla tarball.
* Comparison of FVWM 2.4.X / 2.5.X (or just run with 2.5.X and where
  necessary add an addendum/footnote where there's any differences in
  syntax.
* Setup
 	- Base setup from tarball (FvwmFormSetup).
 	  (Distros tend not to provide pre-built .fvwm2rc files in lieu of
	  this).
	- Example .fvwm2rc files distributed with the tarball (	)

	- fvwm-{themes,crystal} - but see later chapters	
* Generic Concepts
 	- Command-line switches to FVWM.
 	- Structure / explanation of .fvwm2rc file with rationale for
 	  recommendation as to why it is that way. 	(Some aspects of the
      file are order dependant still).
* Functions
 	- Builtin functions (a la ConfigFvwmDefaults).
 	- User-defined functions (a la StartFunction).
* Context
 	- Window
 	- Menu
 	- Function
 	- Changing contexts (forcing contexts therein for some
      operations).
* Modules
 	- Standard
 	- Non/Standard.
 	| Things like FvwmEvent, FvwmScript, FvwmButtons ought to get the
 	  shit documented out of them.
* Decors
 	- Styles.
 	- Vectors.
 	- Pixmaps.
* Focus policies.
* Bindings.
 	- Key
 	- Mouse
* Window Operations
 	- Moving
	- Resizing
 	- Maximising
 	- etc...
* "Scripting"
 	- PipeRead.
 	- Perllib
 	- rubylib (:P -- perhaps released as part of the book	)
